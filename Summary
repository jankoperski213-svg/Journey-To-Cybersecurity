# Cybersecurity Notes

## Definition of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption.  
The goal is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (the CIA triad).

## 3 Key Threats Learned in the Course
1. **Insider threats** – people with access to systems or data may intentionally or unintentionally cause harm.  
2. **Human error** – accidental actions by employees that can lead to data leaks, malware infections, or system failures.  
3. **Malware** – malicious software such as viruses, worms, and trojans that can infect systems and steal or destroy data.  

## Why I Want to Continue
I want to develop my skills in Cybersecurity because it is a dynamic and growing field that combines technology, logic, and creative problem-solving. The skills I gain will allow me to protect systems and data from real threats while pursuing a new, rewarding career.
